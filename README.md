# LUBM (The Lehigh University Benchmark)

The java source code is downloaded from [the official website of LUBM](http://swat.cse.lehigh.edu/projects/lubm/).
The version of this copy is 1.7, which is the latest one at the time when the code is downloaded.

What this repo does is:

1. Organize the code as a Maven project
2. Convert the generated data into a labeled graph, i.e., lubm_to_labeled_graph.cpp

Usage:

By running `./generate.sh`, we compile the probject, generate the benchmark data and convert the data into a labeled graph.
